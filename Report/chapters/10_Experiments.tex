\hl{SECTION UNDER CONSTRUCTION}\\
This chapter describes the setup of the experiments executed. First the data sets used in the experiments are described. Then the measures and the setup of the experiments are introduced.\\
The experiments shall provide information, which is not given in Saenko \& Kotenko \cite{saenko2012design}. In particular how parameters can be set and how the objectives of the role models evolve and impact other objectives. Also the EA is executed on datasets commonly used in role mining research.

\section{Data Sets}
\subsection{Real Datasets}
In many research papers the same datasets are used for performance evaluation of role mining algorithms. Table \ref{tab:realDatasets} lists some of these data sets and their components. The authors of \cite{Ene} obtained these datasets from Cisco firewalls and the Lotus Domino server of the Hewlett Packard (HP) networks. The healthcare dataset was collected from the US Veteranâ€™s Administration.

In Xu \& Stolter\cite{Xu} the authors created an algorithm to generate user attribute information on the datasets in table \ref{tab:realDatasets}.\hl{More details}

\subsection{Synthetic Datasets}
Some papers are providing data generators for synthetic datasets for the performance evaluation of the various role mining algorithms\cite{Vaidya:2006:RMR:1180405.1180424}. These data generators only consider users, permissions and their assignment to each other. They do not consider user attribute information. Due to this a new synthetic data generator has been created for this thesis, where, amongst other configurations, the dimensions of users and permissions can be defined. The data generator is based on a reversed role-engineering process and generates users, roles, rules, user-role matrix, role-permission matrix, user-permission matrix and a user-permission matrix with noise. A more detailed description of data generator can be read in the Appendix \ref{sec:dataGenerator}.\\
Three datasets have been generated with the data generator in order to execute experiments with fitness functions $F_{basic\_INT}^{min}$ \eqref{eq:FBasicMin_INT} and $F_{edge\_INT}^{min}$ \eqref{eq:FEdgeMin_INT}. The synthetic datasets are listed in table \ref{tab:syntheticDatasets}.

\section{Experiments with Evo-RoleMiner}
\hl{SECTION UNDER CONSTRUCTION}\\
The experiments have been divided into several phases, where the results of one phase lead to the setup of the experiments in the next phase.\\
In the first phase single objectives introduced in section \ref{sec:optimizationCompleteness}, \ref{sec:optimizationComplexity} and \ref{sec:optimizationComprehension} are set as fitness function in the Evo-RoleMiner. This phase was executed to validate the implementation of the objective functions, which are combined at a later stage, and to analyse the impact of these objectives to each other. The findings lead to the setup in phase two, where the actual fitness functions for the Basic-RMP, Min-Edge-RMP and Interference-RMP (see section \ref{sec:fitnessFunctions}) are used in the Evo-RoleMiner.\\
All experiments have been executed ten times and started with a random start-population. The experiments have been executed on the healthcare dataset (see Figure \ref{fig:healthcare}) and on a synthetic dataset generated by the data generator (see Figure \ref{fig:dataset1}).

\subsection{Phase One - Validation}
\label{sec:phase1}
For the first phase the single objective functions are validated by using them as fitness function in the Evo-RoleMiner. A basic setup is chosen seen in Table \ref{tab:setup1}. The experiments are based on the small synthetic dataset 1. The number for individuals and generation is chosen relatively low since it is not aim to find a solution but rather to confirm the implementation and to analyse the single objectives in relation to each other. \\

For the single objective "Minimizing Confidentiality" it is expected that the individuals (role models) violate confidentiality compared to the original access configuration $UPA$ less over time. The results in Figure \ref{fig:exp1conf} are confirming this and also show that individuals have less roles over time, since the probability of violating confidentiality falls with a lower count of roles and according lower user-role and role-permission assignments. Due to less roles, the availability violations are rising, since the probability of violating availability rises with a lower count of roles. An opposite impact can be seen when single objective "Minimizing Availability" is used as fitness function (see Figure \ref{fig:exp1accs}).\hl{, which is confirming the relation of completeness to complexity}\\

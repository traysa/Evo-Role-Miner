Role-based access control (RBAC) is the most used access control model nowadays due to the advantage to lower the complexity and costs of access control administration. One major task in RBAC is the role engineering, the creation of a Role Model. Different algorithms are applied on current assignments of users to permissions in order to obtain a role model in reasonable time. From this the term Role-Mining was derived. While research in role mining is mainly based on data mining approaches, very little research has been done on role mining with an evolutionary computation approach. In this thesis an evolutionary approach to evolve an RBAC role model from a given access control policy towards an optimal solution is investigated. An evolutionary algorithm for role mining based on a simple evolutionary algorithm and on a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is developed. Several role mining objectives are investigated and tested on the developed algorithms.

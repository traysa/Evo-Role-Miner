\section{Experiment 7 - Constraints}
\label{sec:exp7}
With the same setup as in table \ref{tab:setup3} the constraint handling option is tested. For dataset 1 the following constraint has been created:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Permission x and y can not be assigned to the same user
\end{itemize}

As seen in one of the example role models from the last generation the constraints are met.

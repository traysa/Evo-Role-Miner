Future Work
\begin{itemize}
\item Different Representation especially when user attributes are included, e.g. Rule-based with Michigan Approach
\item Measure for Interpretability of Roles
\item Novelty Search
\item Testing on bigger datasets
\item Co-Evolution approach
\item Integration of human interaction
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Limited diversity in the final population; Novelty Search might help
	\item Interpretability measure only measures if there are reasonable rules or not; Advanced measure might help
\end{itemize}

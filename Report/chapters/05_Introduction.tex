Access Control Policies are maintaining security policies as direct assignments from access rights (permissions) to identities (users, computers or other principals). In order to lower the complexity and cost of access control administration, access control models were introduced. The most used access control model in the recent years in enterprise identity management systems is the Role-based Access Control (RBAC)\cite{Kunz}. RBAC security policies are grouping permissions into roles, which then are assigned to identities.

One major task of RBAC is the role engineering, the creation of a Role Model. There are two approaches to build a role model: Top-Down and Bottom-Up. While in the Top-Down approach the role model is created by defining enterprise roles out of business processes, like e.g. the job descriptions, the Bottom-Up approach tries to create reasonable enterprise roles by taking current assignments of users to permissions into account. The Top-Down approach has the disadvantage that the designed roles do not contain all current access right assignments, which could lead to problems, when the model is applied. Furthermore the top-down approach is a long process with high costs. In the Bottom-Up approach data mining or artificial intelligence techniques are applied on current assignments of users to permissions in order to get results in reasonable time. But often these results do not have any business meaning, so that they do not get adopted by managers and system administrators, which are responsible for the correct assignment of these roles. Several workshops are needed to transform the mined role model into a realistic role model, which is accepted by the business. A hybrid model is combining data mining techniques with business knowledge to exploit the advantages of both approaches\cite{Frank} \cite{Xu} \cite{Coyne:2011}.

The desired goal in role mining is finding an RBAC model, which can lower the complexity and cost of access control administration the most. The measuring of the current quality of a role model and selecting criteria for its optimization is still unsolved. There are several quality measures for an RBAC model, which can be dependent on the enterprises policy. The quality measures of an RBAC model can rely on the overall RBAC state or on single roles within the RBAC model. The most addressed quality measures in existing role mining algorithms are, among others, achieving completeness, minimize the number of roles, decrease role set similarity, increasing role coverage, fulfill role constraints, Minimize Users/Permissions per Role and Minimize/Maximize Roles per User/Permission\cite{Kunz}.

There are several challenges in role mining. When taking business information into account, relevant and usable business information has to be identified and applied within the mining process. Relevant business information could be e.g. the hierarchy of organizational unit or location of an user. The quality of the data has also a big influence on the result. This is not only influenced by noise removal of the data set, but also which data set is used.

Additionally the mined role model should take constraints into account, such as Separation of duties (SoD) and exceptions. \cite{Lu}

Another challenge in RBAC is the maintaining of the role model. Permissions, Users and business information are evolving over time and the role model might become suboptimal over time. There is a practical need for periodic quality assessment of the resulting role models\cite{Kunz}. A complete re-modelling would not be a feasible solution, since the system administrators and managers would not accept if the role model is regularly restructured. A solution which slowly evolves the role model with the occurring changes has to be designed.

When users with domain knowledge interact within the role mining process, an appropriate visualisation of role mining results has to be developed. Also how to incorporate background domain knowledge to evaluate the results or to guide the search towards a result has to be considered. \cite{Han}


\section{Motivation}
\hl{Why is Role Mining done?}
Evolutionary algorithms seem to be a promising approach for role mining for several reasons. Role mining is following several objectives, e.g. minimizing the number of roles and minimizing the number of confidentiality and availability violations (over- and underentitlements), which can be in conflict with each other. With multiobjective evolutionary algorithms pareto-optimal solutions, a set of optimal trade-offs solutions, can be found in a single run instead of several runs, which is necessary for some of the conventional stochastic processes, like simulated annealing and tabu search\cite{abraham2005evolutionary}. Previous research in the role mining field are using scalarisation, where several objectives are weighted and summarized in one single objective, like the Weighted Structural Complexity (WSC) in Molloy et al.\cite{Molloy} or the fitness function for the basic RMP in Saenko \& Kotenko\cite{saenko2012design}. The trade-offs between the objectives are not apparent in these approaches.

Furthermore the task of role engineering is an on-going process. After an initial role model is created, the user-permission relation can change over time and therefore the roles in the role model can become suboptimal. Evolutionary algorithms can adapt solutions to changing circumstances\cite{Fogel:1997}. A current role model state can be used as starting population and the evolutionary algorithm will optimize towards the formulated objective in the fitness functions.

At last role engineering is still a process, which requires human interaction. The role mining results are evaluated by humans and modified to an extend that it is accepted by the business. Interactive evolutionary computation (IEC)\cite{949485} could include human feedback to the algorithm to navigate the evolutionary algorithm to an optimal result. In IEC the fitness function is replaced by an human user.

\section{Thesis question}
How can the role mining problem be solved efficiently with an evolutionary computation approach and how adequate are the results?

\section{Roadmap}
The remainder of this thesis report is organized as follows. The thesis starts with an introduction to the domain of RBAC and Role Mining (Chapter \ref{sec:domain}). Afterwards an introduction to evolutionary algorithms is given, where the basic concepts are explained and a description of algorithms is given (Chapter \ref{sec:EA}). With the background information to the domain and evolutionary algorithms the related work described in Chapter \ref{sec:relatedWork} should be comprehensible. In Chapter \ref{sec:approach} the approach and implementation is described and discussed. The experiments and according results can be read in Chapter \ref{sec:experiments}. A discussion on the results and the approach is given in Chapter \ref{sec:discussion}. Chapter \ref{sec:futureWork} gives an outlook for future work. At last a conclusion is given in Chapter \ref{sec:conclusion}, where the work is summarized and the most important findings are highlighted.

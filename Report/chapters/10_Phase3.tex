\subsection{Phase Three - Parameters}
\label{sec:phase3}
In the third phase the fitness functions $F_{basic}^{min}$ \eqref{eq:FBasicMin} and $F_{edge}^{min}$ \eqref{eq:FEdgeMin} are tested again on the small synthetic dataset 1 and the healthcare dataset, but with an adjusted setup as shown in table \ref{tab:setup3}. The setup is relaxing the objective for minimizing the role model complexity.\\

The results can be seen in experiment 4 in table \ref{tab:results_exp2_dataset1} and experiment 5 in table \ref{tab:results_exp2_healthcare}. The results show that solutions with better fitness can be found by adjusting the parameters. The best fitness solution of the experiments with the healthcare dataset can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:exp5edge_RM}. The solution belongs to the experiments with fitness functions $F_{edge}^{min}$ and has a role count of 14, one confidentiality violation, 23 availability violations, 152 user-role- and 192 role-permission-assignments. Example fitness-optimal solution for the synthetic dataset 1 can be seen in the Appendix in Figure \ref{fig:exp4aBasic_RM} and \ref{fig:exp4bEdge_RM}.\\
There are many parameters, which can be adjusted and other settings might lead to even better results. But these adjustments have been done based on some knowledge, which might not be given.
